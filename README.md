# bert_sentiment_japanese       
         
This repository contains code for a toy system on sentiment classification in Japanese.

It fine-tunes a Japanese BERT model on the KNBC sentiment dataset. 

Part of the code is borrowed and adapted from the great Chris McCkormick's BERT Tutorial --> http://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/
